## How to use

~~~
$ yarn add @educandu/educandu
~~~

Use it in code as follows:

~~~
import educandu from '@educandu/educandu';

educandu({
  port: 3000,
  mongoConnectionString: 'mongodb://root:rootpw@localhost:27017/dev-educandu-db?replicaSet=educandurs&authSource=admin',
  skipMaintenance: process.env.TEST_APP_SKIP_MAINTENANCE === true.toString(),
  cdnEndpoint: 'http://localhost:9000',
  cdnRegion: 'eu-central-1',
  cdnAccessKey: 'UVDXF41PYEAX0PXD8826',
  cdnSecretKey: 'SXtajmM3uahrQ1ALECh3Z3iKT76s2s5GBJlbQMZx',
  cdnBucketName: 'dev-educandu-cdn',
  cdnRootUrl: 'http://localhost:9000/dev-educandu-cdn',
  sessionSecret: 'd4340515fa834498b3ab1aba1e4d9013',
  sessionDurationInMinutes: 60,
  emailSenderAddress: 'educandu-test-app@test.com',
  smtpOptions: 'smtp://localhost:8025/?ignoreTLS=true',
  publicFolders: ['./test-app/dist', './test-app/static'].map(x => path.resolve(x)),
  resources: ['./test-app/resource-overrides.json'].map(x => path.resolve(x)),
  initialUser: {
    username: 'test',
    password: 'test',
    email: 'test@test.com'
  },
  exposeErrorDetails: true,
  exportApiKey: 'GSD54GDFgDGesdfs4'
  importSources: [{
    name: 'otherSystem',
    hostName: 'othersystem.com',
    apiKey: 'FSERFSF56Ggsdfg6FGED'
  }],
  additionalControllers: [],
  consentCookieName: 'APP_CONSENT_COOKIE_NAME'
});
~~~

This should run the entire application and provide you with an admin user as defined on the initialUser setting.

## How to override the styles

In order to override the styles provided by educandu you need to import the main.less of the educandu project and override the less variables provided. An example override implementation is provided by the test-app in the 
main.less file. We will keep this file updated so any user will know what can be overriden. Alternatively you can go 
to the global-variables.less in educandu and consult the list there.

## How to run and develop locally

~~~
$ yarn
$ gulp                 # run the test application
$ gulp --instances 3   # run 3 instances behind a load balancer
$ gulp --tunnel        # run using the tunnel proxy
~~~

This will build and start up the TestApp (in watch mode), which is set up to use educandu.

By default the application requires that the following ports are available to be taken:
  * 3000: the application itself (or the load balancer)
  * 400x: the individual application instances, in case of load balancing
  * 8000: maildev UI, can be used for debugging emails that would be sent to the users (head to http://localhost:8000 when the application is running)
  * 8025: maildev smpt server port
  * 9000: minio docker image (local CDN used for testing)
  * 21017: mongodb docker image port

The ports can be changed in the gulp file and must be changed in the gulpfile.js and need to be reflected in the test-app/index.js.

The gulpfile has a number of useful tasks which can be run with "gulp taskName", here are some more widely used:
 * test: runs all tests (with coverage)
 * testWatch: runs tests in watch mode
 * testChanged: runs tests that were affected by the current modifications
 * lint: runs lint
 * up: starts all the containers (if not already running)
 * down: stops all the containers and deletes them


## How add additional controllers
  In order to extend the educandu functionality you can add your custom controllers. These should be classes that expose one or more of the following methods:
   * registerApi: regiters API endpoints
   * registerPages: registers additional pages
   * registerMiddleware: regiters some middleware
   * registerErrorHandler: regiters error handlers
  
  
An example implementation is given in the test app for registering a redirect from an "/articles" page to the standard "doc/:docKey/*" page of educandu. You can find the additional controller
in the article-controller.js file.
